# **Task:**
> - Find and download satellite imagery that is split up by band. [Landsat](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-data-access) is a great choice.  Add the imagery to your Github.
> - Using the satellite imagery you downloaded, create a composite raster image
> - Find a digital elevation model of your area of interest and create the following: [Shace-Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) is a great choice.  Add the DEM to your Github.
>   - A hillshade analysis raster
>   - A slope analysis raster
>
# **To Hand In:**
1. Link to your Github page that contains the Python code 60pts
2. Provide screenshot of your composit raster image 20pts
3. Provide screenshot of your hillshade raster image 10pts
4. Provide screenshot of you slope analysis raster image 10pts

# Raster analysis
For this homework assignment, you will be finding and downloading your own satellite imagery and combining the different bands into a single composite image. Once you have your composite image, you'll be tasked with finding a digital elevation model raster for your area of interest. With your DEM in hand, create a hillshade analysis raster and a slope analysis raster.
