# **Task:**
> - Find and download satellite imagery that is split up by band
> - Create a composite image using the rasters you downloaded
> - Make a clipping mask polygon of the darkest area you can find
> - Create an atmospherically corrected multiband raster

# **To Hand In:**
1. Link to your Github page that contains the Python code
# Atmospherically corrected mutliband raster
For this homework assignment, you will be creating whats known as an atmospherically corrected multiband raster. What this entails is finding the darkest / blackest region of a raster and creating a polygon feature that covers the entire area. Once you have both a composite image and a feature layer that contains the polygon (also called the clipping mask), you 
# Download satellite imagery
A great place to get satellite imagery is from USGS and their **EarthExplorer** platform. The area you select does not matter for this exercise, just make sure that for the **Data Sets** option you select **Landsat**. 
# Composite image
Using the information from the second rasters lecture, create a composite image from your downloaded raster imagery.
# Clipping mask
