# **Task:**  Building your own Wireframe
## This is a basic outline of your Wireframe, but please build your own.
1. Build a GitHub File that has the Wireframe of the Industry Problem with references to your work as examples. (Be creative)
2. Outline
 - Where will the software development be done.  Lab 1
 - You need to load several sets of data that represents the Well locations. Lab 3
 - Inverse coordinates of the different Well locations to determine if any agree or their accuracy. Lab 2
 - Write to Master Well Geodatabase. Lab 4
 - Build a buffer to determine if the Well(s) were put in NAD83 vs. NAD 27. Lab 5
 - Build a graduated color Wells to indicate confidence of Master Well location. Lab 6
 - Use aerial images to check Master Well DB. Lab 7
3. Discuss how you plan to:
 - Justify the Return on Investment (ROI)
 - Interface with Users
 - Gather requirements
 - Softwares, DBs, etc will be used
 - Code with usages of NumPy, SciPy, PySAL, Model Builder and/or ArcPy
 - Approach commenting, testing, status updates, and reporting
 - Deploy, maintain, and archive your software
# **To Hand In:**
1. Build a GitHub ePortfolio linking  your course work as examples in a problem solving format. [Examples](http://wp.auburn.edu/writing/eportfolio-project/eportfolio-examples/) 600 pts
>
# **Extra Credit:**
1. Utilizing Microsoft Sway (Free for TAMU Students @ [Office 365](https://gateway.tamu.edu/office365/) copy your ePortfolio to Sway formatting 100 pts

# ePortfolio
An electronic portfolio (also known as an eportfolio, e-portfolio, digital portfolio, or online portfolio is a collection of electronic evidence assembled and managed by a user, usually on the Web. Such electronic evidence may include input text, electronic files, images, multimedia, blog entries, and hyperlinks. E-portfolios are both demonstrations of the user's abilities and platforms for self-expression. If they are online, users can maintain them dynamically over time.

Our goal is to make a GitHub ePortfolio of our course in a Software Engineering Wireframe or Workflow Diagram.  Software development is best visualized using Wireframe or Workflow Diagrams similar to Model Builder or FME. 

We will build a Wireframe that solves an industry problem and references our ePortfolio as a Artifacts.  [Please Review Software Engineering Section](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-676-GIS-Programming/Content/blob/master/modules/04__1.md)

# Industry Problem

 You are asked to build a software tool that builds a Master Well Database from numerous different databases.  Often companies have several databases of where they think their Wells are located.  These could be from CAD, ArcGIS, Decision Space Geographics, [Petrel](https://www.software.slb.com/products/petrel), [OpenWells](https://www.landmark.solutions/OpenWells), [COMPASS](https://www.landmark.solutions/COMPASS-Directional-Well-Path-Planning), Drilling Info, HSI, State Regulatory, etc.  All these might not agree on the Well location.  

# To make a Master Well dataset you are going propose a GIS Software tool that:
1. Imports all data opinions of well location
2. Inverses between all the data and write to Master Well Location trending position
3. Build a check that determines if the coordinate was NAD83 vs. NAD 27
4. Build a tool that allows users to select the Master Well Location from different aerial images.
