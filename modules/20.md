- Detail what cursors are and why you would use them
# Cursors
You may recall in the tool lecture or elsewhere in another lecture the use of a method **SearchCursor()**. What is a cursor you may have asked. **Cursors** are data access objects that let the programmer look for or update data in a table. Cursors come in three "flavors": insert, search, and update cursors. With a reference to a cursor, we have access to methods that range from inserting new data in a table to retrieving values from a table.
>
## InsertCursor()
The **InsertCursor()** function is used to generate a new cursor for writing data to a feature class or table. With an insert cursor, we are free to add new rows into our input data. Keep in mind that the feature you are trying to insert must match the geometry type of the input feature class; points to points, lines to lines, and polygons to polygons.
>
In the example below we are adding in a new point feature to our imaginary feature class Albritton. To add in the feature, we create a tuple named **towerLocation** with a string containing the **BldgName** of our feature, and an inner tuple containing the location of the feature. Once we have our insert cursor, we call the method **insertRow()** and provide in our **towerLocation** variable. We must take care as to delete our cursors after use so that ArcGIS doesn't keep a lock on our data preventing us from using the layer until the Python process is done.
>
```python
import arcpy
# Define our geodatabase
campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/20/Campus.gdb"
# Define our tower point location
towerLocation = ('Albritton Bell Tower', (30.61320, -96.34381))
# Create the insert cursor
insertCursor = arcpy.da.InsertCursor(campus + "/Albritton", ["BldgName", "SHAPE@XY"])
# Insert a new row into the feature class
insertCursor.insertRow(towerLocation)
# Delete insertCursor to free the data lock
del insertCursor

```
>
## SearchCursor()
The **SearchCursor()** is used to look for a particular value in an input data set such as a feature class or a table. We can provide a where clause when creating a search cursor that limits the values returned, but since search cursors can return more than one value, we will need to traverse the returned values somehow. We can iterate through a search cursor in two ways: with a simple for loop, or by calling the built-in **next()** function.
>
The example below is defining a new **SearchCursor()** that will open up the feature class **/GaragePoints** inside our locally referenced **Campus** geodatabase and perform a search. We provide a list of field names within the feature class we would like to have returned along with the data. Here is a good place to limit the attributes so you do not end up returning 10 or more useless attributes in the process. Once we have our cursor we print it out using this super fancy print statement.
>
```python
import arcpy
# Define our geodatabase
campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/20/Campus.gdb"
# Define the fields we want
fields = ['Name', 'LotType', 'LotName']
# Define our search cursor 
searchCursor = arcpy.da.SearchCursor(campus + "/GaragePoints", fields)
for row in searchCursor:
    print(u'{0}, {1}, {2}'.format(row[0], row[1], row[2]))
# Delete the cursor to free the data lock
del searchCursor
```
>
Below you will find yet another way to print out all the values returned by our search cursor. Instead of using the iteration control provided by the for loop, we instead opt to use the while loop and call **next()** on the cursor every time instead. Whenever **next()** raises a **StopIteration** error, we know we've reached the end of the feature class and halt execution iteration.
>
```python
import arcpy
# Define our geodatabase
campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/20/Campus.gdb"
# Define the fields we want
fields = ['Name', 'LotType', 'LotName']
# Define our search cursor 
searchCursor = arcpy.da.SearchCursor(campus + "/GaragePoints", fields)
try:
    # Setup row variable with the first value 
    row = next(searchCursor)
    while row:
        print(u'{0}, {1}, {2}'.format(row[0], row[1], row[2]))
        # Set row equal to the next row in the cursor
        row = next(searchCursor)
except StopIteration:
    print("No more records")
# Delete the cursor to free the data lock
del searchCursor
```
>

## UpdateCursor()
An **UpdateCursor()** is used to change the value of a row in an input or remove a row entirely from an input. It is important when using an update cursor to remember to delete the cursor, or else it will hold a lock on the data making it difficult to use in GIS.
>
Below we use an update cursor to find a particular row in a feature class **GaragePoints**. The cursor initially grabs all the values in the feature class; this requires us to loop through the returned values and look for the row that contains **Garage** as the value for field **LotType**. Once we've found that row, we then change the value of the row item by using a plain assignment with an equal sign.
>
```python
import arcpy
# Define our geodatabase
campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/20/Campus.gdb"
# Define the fields we want
fields = ['Name', 'LotType', 'LotName']
# Define our search cursor 
updateCursor = arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(campus + "/GaragePoints", field_names=fields)
# Loop through the cursor looking for the row that contains Garage as a LotType
for row in updateCursor:
    if row[1] == "Garage":
        row[1] = "Garage Visitor"
        updateCursor.updateRow(row)
# Delete the cursor to free the data lock   
del updateCursor
```
>
In addition to changing values of rows in a feature class, we can also delete rows from a feature class using an update cursor. All we need to do is call **deleteRow()** on the **updateCursor** variable whenever we are currently on the row that we wish to remove. The code below calls **deleteRow()** whenever the row has a **LotName** equal to **CENTURY SQUARE**.
>
```python
import arcpy
# Define our geodatabase
campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/20/Campus.gdb"
# Define the fields we want
fields = ['Name', 'LotType', 'LotName']
# Define our search cursor 
updateCursor = arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(campus + "/GaragePoints", field_names=fields)
# Loop through the cursor looking for the row that contains CENTURY SQUARE as a LotName
for row in updateCursor:
    if row[2] == "CENTURY SQUARE":
        updateCursor.deleteRow()
# Delete the cursor to free the data lock
del updateCursor
```
