# TAMU GIS Programming
# Learning Objectives
- Learn how to use arcpy in the creation of:
    - UniqueValue maps
    - GraduatedColors (Choropleth) maps
# Renderers
Renderers are used by ArcGIS to determine *how* feature data gets drawn on the screen. Data is just data until we have a renderer that tells the program exactly how that data should presented to the user. The four basic feature renderer types are SimpleRenderer, UniqueValueRenderer, GraduatedColorsRenderer, and GraduatedSymbolsRenderer. Below we will dive into what each renderer is and present a use case for why you may want to use a specific renderer.
>
It is important to note that not *all* layers support renderers, so always make sure to check that the layer has a **renderer** attribute before trying its renderer.
## SimpleRenderer
The most basic of renderers, the **SimpleRenderer** is used to draw all features of a layer the same. This is the default renderer used whenever we add a feature class to a map; you know the plain, all-one-color features look. We will not bother diving into how to use this renderer as they are the default and they tend to be rather boring.
>
## UniqueValueRenderer
**UniqueValueRenderer** is used to distinguish features in a feature layer based off of some classification, usually a data field. With this renderer, we are given programmatic control over the type of field used in the classification of features as well as the color ramp used when drawing said features.
>
Below you will see a code example of a UniqueValueRenderer in use.
>
## GraduatedColorsRenderer
**GraduatedColorsRenderer** is used to render features in a feature layer based off of a specific field in the feature class. We can use this particular renderer for creating choropleth maps programmatically; useful if you need to quickly produce such maps. This renderer gives us control over the style of choropleth produced; allowing the user to determine how many bins are present as well as the color ramp used.
>
Below you will see a code example of a GraduatedColorsRenderer in use.
>
## GraduatedSymbolsRenderer
The **GraduatedSymbolsRenderer** is quite similar to GraduatedColorsRenderer in that each let you render features in a feature class depending on a number of bins and let you specify the color ramp used. This style of renderer is useful for creating graduated symbol styled maps.

# Making a map with UniqueValueRenderer
Our example for **UniqueValueRenderer** will focus on automating the creation of a unique value map using the **Structures** feature class present in the Campus.gdb from previous lectures.
>
The first thing you will want to do is open up ArcGIS Pro and add a folder connection to the geodatabase that contains our feature class. Once the connection is made, we need to add the **Structures** feature class to the map. Save the project .aprx to a location you can reference using arcpy. Your map should look something like this:
>
![Plain map](../images/modules/23/plain_map.png)
>
With the .aprx saved, we can start on our Python script. The first step of any script is to import the arcpy module. With the module imported, we need to get a reference to our .aprx project file. Using the built-in arcpy method **ArcGISProject()**, we simply provide the path to the file and we have our reference. After we reference the .aprx, we create a variable that holds a reference to the first map in our project. To do so, we use the **listMaps()** function to get our campus map shown above. The parameter used inside the function **listMaps()** is the name given by default to a new map inside a newly created project.
>
```python
import arcpy
project = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject(r"C:/tmp/ArcGISPython/" + r"\\Mod23.aprx")
campus = project.listMaps('Map')[0]
```
>
Now that we have a reference to the map, we can loop through the layers present in said map. Using the method **listLayers()** we can get a list of all layers in the map from which we can iterate through. The first thing we want to do is make sure the layer is a feature layer. We can check using a simple conditional that checks the current layer's **isFeatureLayer** attribute: if it is true we continue to set the renderer. The next step is to create a copy of the current feature layer's symbology. Symbology is the attribute that contains a layer's renderer. We copy the symbology to make the naming a little easier to read. 
>
A very important step when altering a layer's renderer in code is to make sure the layer has an attribute **renderer** before proceeding. If we try to reference a layer's renderer without it actually containing one, we'll end up raising an exception. The last check we need to do is to make sure the current layer's name is "Structures", if our map contains multiple layers we want to change the renderer on the correct one.
>
Now that we have the feature class we want, we can *finally* start to change our renderer. The whole process is surprisingly quick and simple if you choose to let arcpy decide the colors and some of the other finer details. With our variable **symbology** we simply call **updateRenderer()** and provide the string value "UniqueValueRenderer". This will set the renderer of **symbology** equal to **UniqueValueRenderer**. Keep in mind that this has only changed the renderer of the *COPY* **symbology**, not the actual layer's symbology. We'll address that in a moment. Once the renderer is updated, we need to let arcpy know what field we want to symbolize our features with. We can set that with **symbology.renderer.fields** and set the value of that equal to a list that contains the field we want to symbolize our features. Now then, set the layer's symbology back to the **symbology** copy we updated. Without this line we will not see any changes. The last step is to simply save a copy of our project's .aprx as a new project if we desire and we're done!

# Grab the first map in the .aprx
campus = project.listMaps('Map')[0]
# Loop through available layers in the map
for layer in campus.listLayers():
    # Check that the layer is a feature layer
    if layer.isFeatureLayer:
        # Obtain a copy of the layer's symbology
        symbology = layer.symbology
        # Makes sure symbology has an attribute "renderer"
        if hasattr(symbology, 'renderer'):
            # Check if the layer's name is "Structures"
            if layer.name == "Structures":
                # Update the copy's renderer to be "UniqueValueRenderer"
                symbology.updateRenderer('UniqueValueRenderer')
                # Tells arcpy that we want to use "Type" as our unique value
                symbology.renderer.fields = ["Type"]
                # Set the layer's actual symbology equal to the copy's
                layer.symbology = symbology # Very important step
            else:
                print("NOT Structures")
project.saveACopy(r"C:/tmp/ArcGISPython/" + r"\\Mod23b.aprx")

# Making a map with GraduatedColorsRenderer
The next example we'll dive into is using a **GraduatedColorsRenderer** to create a choropleth map. Many of the same ideas and code used in the previous example will be used here. We start by creating a new project (.aprx) file and add in a data layer. For this map, we'll be using the **GarageParking** feature class and creating a choropleth based off the **Shape_Area** data field. Add the layer to the map and save to the usual location. Create a new, plain Python script and import arcpy. Create a variable that references the newly created project file. With that done, make a variable that references the map that contains your data layer in the project. At this point, you should be here:
>
```python
import arcpy
project = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject(r"C:/tmp/ArcGISPython/" + r"\\Mod23.aprx")
campus = project.listMaps('Map')[0]
```

Once more we need to perform some checks to make sure we are dealing with a feature class, it is the correct feature class, and it has a renderer attribute. First, we loop through the available layers returned by the function **listLayers()**. On each layer we check to make sure the current layer is a feature class; if so we copy that layer's symbology to a new variable called **symbology**. The last check we need to perform is to make sure the name of the layer is the layer we want to change the renderer of. If we've found the right layer we can change it's renderer. Remember that we make the changes to the **symbology** variable first, then set the layer's **layer.symbology** attribute equal to our **symbology** variable. Using **updateRenderer()** we pass in a value of **GraduatedColorsRenderer**. After that, we set the **symbology.renderer.classificationField**, an attribute not used in our UniqueValueRenderer example, equal to the data field we will be using to determine our classification. Now with our classification field set, we need to tell arcpy how many bins we wish to create; for this example we are going to use five bins. Our renderer is almost set! Now we need to set a color ramp, else our choropleth will look quite dull. We can query our project for a list of available color ramps by using the **listColorRamps()** function without any parameters. We'll be using a simple orange color ramp. Since **listColorRamps()** returns a list of values, we will use the square brackets to tell it we want the first value in the list of returned color ramps. The last renderer setup step is to set the **layer.symbology** equal to our **symbology** variable and we should be golden! Remember to save your resulting project.

```python
import arcpy
# Reference to our .aprx
project = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject(r"C:/tmp/ArcGISPython/" + r"\\Mod23.aprx")
# Grab the first map in the .aprx
campus = project.listMaps('Map')[0]
# Loop through available layers in the map
for layer in campus.listLayers():
    # Check if layer is a feature layer
    if layer.isFeatureLayer:
        # Obtain a copy of the layer's symbology
        symbology = layer.symbology
        # Check if it has a 'renderer' attribute
        if hasattr(symbology, 'renderer'):
            # Check if the layer's name is 'GarageParking'
            if layer.name == "GarageParking":
                # Update the copy's renderer to be 'GraduatedColorsRenderer'
                symbology.updateRenderer('GraduatedColorsRenderer')
                # Tell arcpy which field we want to base our choropleth off of
                symbology.renderer.classificationField = "Shape_Area"
                # Set how many classes we'll have 
                symbology.renderer.breakCount = 5
                # Set the color ramp
                symbology.renderer.colorRamp = project.listColorRamps('Oranges (5 Classes)')[0]
                # Set the layer's actual symbology equal to the copy's
                layer.symbology = symbology # Very important step
            else:
                print("NOT GarageParking")
project.saveACopy(r"C:/tmp/ArcGISPython/" + r"\\Mod23c.aprx")
