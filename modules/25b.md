# TAMU GIS Programming
# Learning Objectives
- Convert to and from common geographic data formats


# Arcpy data format conversions

Being able to work with any data format that you can find (or are given) is an important skill. Known lovingly as **Data Wrangling**, this will unfortunately be one of the main tasks that you find yourself doing.

Despite your expert opinion, you will find that one or more of the following continue to plague you throughout your career as a GIS programming:
- Your colleagues still keep asking you for KML layers so they can show their data using Google Earth in a presentation
- The only data you can find for a task you need is in GeoJSON or KML format
- Someone's kid told them about the MapBox mobile API, and now you have to a  GeoJSON data layers to be shown in the app
- You need to pull data from an ArcServer with code, and it only exports Esri JSON 

## CSV
Details on what it is. 

Example data set you post along with the class showing the structure

- read in xy data set, [convert and import to geodatabase layer](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/conversion/table-to-table.htm)
>
```python
def readInCSV():
    # Read in .csv, add to .gdb
    teams = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/code/25/teams.csv"
    campus = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/data/modules/25/Campus.gdb"
    stadiums = arcpy.management.MakeXYEventLayer(teams, "lon", "lat", campus + "Stadiums")    
    arcpy.FeatureClassToGeodatabase_conversion(stadiums, campus)
```

```python
    # Read in .gdb, export to .csv
    campus = r"D:\DevSource\Tamu\GeoInnovation\_GISProgramming\data\modules\25\Campus.gdb"
    garages = campus + "/GaragePoints"
    garageFile = r"D:/DevSource/Tamu/GeoInnovation/_GISProgramming/code/25/garagesFromGdb.csv"
    search = arcpy.da.SearchCursor(garages, field_names=["Name", "SHAPE@XY"])
    file = open(garageFile, "w")
    file.write("GarageName,lon,lat\n")
    for row in search:
        print(row)
        file.write("%s,%s,%s\n" % (row[0], row[1][0], row[1][1]))
```

## KML
Details on what it is. 

Example data set you post along with the class showing the structure

- read in KML data set, [convert and import to geodatabase layer](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/conversion/kml-to-layer.htm)
- read in geodatabase layer, [convert and export to KML](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/conversion/layer-to-kml.htm)


## ESRI JSON
Before we dive into what ESRI's JSON specification is, I will try to explain what plain JSON is. **JSON**, or Javascript Object Notation, is a language-agnostic data structure that originated with Javascript but has since been adopted by many other languages such as C# and Python. We use JSON as a means to organize data in a compact and human readable structure much like a .csv organizes data in a structure that is readable by humans. Unlike .csv's which use commas to separate data, JSON uses a key-value structure; an example of this is found below:
>
```json
{
    "Will": "Will Smith",
    "Uncle Phil": "James Avery",
    "Carlton": "Alfonso Ribeiro",
    "Aunt Viv": {
        "first": "Janet Hubert",
        "second": "Daphne Reid"
    },
    "Aunt Viv Array": ["Janet Hubert", "Daphne Reid"]
}
```
>
Each key-value pair is separated by a colon with the left side being the key and the right side being the value. We can have anything as a value in JSON such as strings, numbers, and arrays. We can even have another JSON object as shown with the key "Aunt Viv".
>
ESRI's JSON is a way of describing geographic data in a JSON format. Unlike GeoJSON seen below, ESRI's JSON is only used by ESRI and is limited in use to pretty much only the ArcGIS REST API. Below you will find a simple example of an ESRI JSON object.
>
```json
{"x" : -118.15, "y" : 33.80, "spatialReference" : {"wkid" : 4326}}
```

Example data set you post along with the class showing the structure

- read in Esri JSON data set, convert and import to geodatabase layer
- read in geodatabase layer, convert and export to Esri JSON
- [Documentation here](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/functions/asshape.htm)


## GeoJSON
Details on what it is. Example data set you post along with the class showing the structure

- read in GeoJSON data set, convert and import to geodatabase layer
- read in geodatabase layer, convert and export to GeoJSON
