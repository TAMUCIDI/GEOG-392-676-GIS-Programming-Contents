# TAMU GIS Programming
# Learning Objectives
- Describe the difference between ESRI's Python products:
    - arcpy
    - ArcGIS API for Python
- Learn about ArcGIS Pro SDK
# ESRI's Python products
You may have noticed while looking for documentation on an arcpy method that ESRI has *several* ArcGIS programming products. You may have even tried to implement code used for one product into another by accident. ESRI uses Python in more places than just the plain arcpy module we've been using.
>
# arcpy
ArcPy is a Python site package that provides a useful and productive way to perform geographic data analysis, data conversion, data management, and map automation with Python.
>
This package provides a rich and native Python experience offering code completion (type a keyword and a dot to get a pop-up list of properties and methods supported by that keyword; select one to insert it) and reference documentation for each function, module, and class.
>
The additional power of using ArcPy is that Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is interpreted and dynamically typed and is suited for interactive work and quick prototyping of one-off programs known as scripts while being powerful enough to write large applications in. ArcGIS applications written with ArcPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of Python by GIS professionals and programmers from many different disciplines.

# ArcGIS API for Python
ArcGIS API for Python is a Python library for working with maps and geospatial data, powered by web GIS. It provides simple and efficient tools for sophisticated vector and raster analysis, geocoding, map making, routing and directions, as well as for organizing and managing a GIS with users, groups and information items. In addition to working with your own data, the library enables access to ready to use maps and curated geographic data from Esri and other authoritative sources. It also integrates well with the scientific Python ecosystem and includes rich support for Pandas and Jupyter notebook.

# ArcGIS Pro SDK
Though it does not utilize Python, the **ArcGIS Pro SDK** is yet another way to expand upon the functionality of ArcGIS Pro. ArcGIS Pro SDK is a software development kit that allows you to create custom add-ins for use inside of ArcGIS Pro using Microsoft .NET. Fully featured, ArcGIS Pro SDK allows you to do the following:
- [Framework](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Framework)
    - Build add-ins which extend the Pro UI and leverage asynchronous programming
- [Editing](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Editing)
    - Create custom tools to construct and edit feature classes with your unique logic
- [Map exploration](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Map-Exploration)
    - Create capabilities to navigate and explore the map in 2D and 3D
- [Content](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Content-and-Items)
    - Manage Pro project content items such as maps, layouts, styles, and more
- [Utility Network](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Utility-Network)
    - Develop custom network traces, editing tools, and diagrams
- [Configurations](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Configurations)
    - Create Pro solution configurations with a custom start page and user experience
- [Map authoring](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Map-Authoring)
    - Create maps, manage content and renderers, and edit symbols, annotation and labeling
- [Geodatabase](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Geodatabase)
    - Edit and work with geodatabase feature data and spatial data stores
- [Geometry](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Geometry)
    - Build and manipulate feature geometries, coordinate systems and datum transformations
- [Layouts](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Layouts)
    - Create layouts and manage layout objects, content and formatting
- [Raster](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Raster)
    - Work with raster datasets, pixel blocks and cursors
- [Geoprocessing](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki/ProConcepts-Geoprocessing)
    - Execute geoprocessing tools and Python scripts from Pro add-ins
